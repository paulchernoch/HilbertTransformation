Description
-----------

This dataset consists of features of handwritten numerals (`0'--`9')
extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. 200 patterns per
class (for a total of 2,000 patterns) have been digitized in  binary
images. These digits are represented in terms of the following six
feature sets (files): 

1. mfeat-fou: 76 Fourier coefficients of the character shapes; 
2. mfeat-fac: 216 profile correlations; 
3. mfeat-kar: 64 Karhunen-Loève coefficients; 
4. mfeat-pix: 240 pixel averages in 2 x 3 windows; 
5. mfeat-zer: 47 Zernike moments; 
6. mfeat-mor: 6 morphological features. 

In each file the 2000 patterns are stored in ASCI on 2000 lines. The
first 200 patterns are of class `0', followed by sets of 200 patterns
for each of the classes `1' - `9'. Corresponding patterns in different
feature sets (files) correspond to the same original character.

The source image dataset is lost. Using the pixel-dataset (mfeat-pix)
sampled versions of the original images may be obtained (15 x 16 pixels).
